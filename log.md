# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I've decided to commit to the 100 days of code challenge, my goal is that by the end of these 100 days I'd have developed a habit of learning a thing or two everyday.

### Day 1: March 16, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Coded a Pikatchu in CSS

**Thoughts:** Got really inspired by sashatran and decided to practice some basic drawings

### Day 2: March 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Better understanding of positions,::before and ::after.

**Thoughts:** Wanted to draw a motorcycle using css but It was not as smooth as pika, lots of tricks involved. Made the chair, wheels and the engine.

### Day 3: March 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Drew a wine bottle and a glass

**Thoughts:** Yesterday's motorocycle was very tough, so I thought I'd do something easier. Wine was very helpful :)
