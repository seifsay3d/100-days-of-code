# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I've decided to commit to the 100 days of code challenge, my goal is that by the end of these 100 days I'd have developed a habit of learning a thing or two everyday.

### Day 1: March 16, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Coded a Pikatchu in CSS

**Thoughts:** Got really inspired by sashatran and decided to practice some basic drawings

**Link to work:** [CSS PIKATUCHU] (http://codepen.io/seifsayed/pen/qrVZBY)
